The "why":Why this structure and not that?Why this algorithm and not that?Why is this abstracted into its own module and not that?</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.8em 0px 0.25em; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(215, 218, 220); background-color: rgba(215, 218, 220, 0.05);">I think it's possible to emulate a good deal of this with just yourself, if you stay honest and consistent:Role-play in your head (or even out loud, if you feel like it) explaining your own thinking and reasoning to someone else, like you were the mentor.Also ask your mentee (yourself) "why" for every statement that she (you) uses. If you cannot answer why you absolutely need that statement and how it contributes to solving the problem, you need to stop and find out.</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.8em 0px 0.25em; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(215, 218, 220); background-color: rgba(215, 218, 220, 0.05);">Role-play asking a mentor about the consequences and limits of the selected approach, about alternatives and modifications.(Obviously this is much more difficult, because you're probably asking a lot of questions for which you don't have any answers at the beginning, but this also shows you what you need to learn.)</p><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0.8em 0px 0.25em; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(215, 218, 220); background-color: rgba(215, 218, 220, 0.05);">An important part of this is to not "talk code".Your solution should work without a computer.

I think eventually reading a few (good) books about software development is inevitable. I'd recommend "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin</p>
